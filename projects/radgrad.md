summary: "RadGrad is a combination of a social network, degree planner, and career explorer. It is intended to improve engagement, retention, and diversity in undergraduate STEM majors."

The fundamental goal of the RadGrad Project is to provide students, faculty, and advisors with an alternative perspective on the undergraduate degree program---which traditionally boils down to a single kind of activity (coursework) and a single metric for success (grade point average).

Our alternative perspective is called the RadGrad Degree Experience, and it gives first class status to both curricular activities (courses) and extracurricular activities (discipline-oriented events, activities, clubs, etc.)
